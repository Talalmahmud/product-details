            "A flash diffuser is an accessory that helps spread the light out to avoid hard product photography lighting. One of the best product photography techniques, using a flash diffuser can help ensure that your product photography is well lit. Good diffusers help illuminate a product or person without a washed out look. They also help create a more natural light look. In general, a flash diffuser helps make pictures look better. When it comes to using the cameraâ€™s built-in flash and a flash diffuser, your best bet is almost always a diffuser.",
